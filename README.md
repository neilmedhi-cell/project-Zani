# project-Zani
An evolving personal AI assistant – Project Zani. From Genesis to Phase 2.0, built to learn, adapt, and automate daily tasks while growing towards a true Jarvis-like system.
# Project Zani

**Project Zani** is my personal AI assistant – a long-term experiment in building a fully autonomous digital companion.  
She began as **Zani v1.0 – Genesis**, a simple terminal-based assistant, and has since grown into **Phase 2.0**, capable of handling memory, automation, and task management.

The vision is for Zani to evolve step by step into a Jarvis-like system:  
an assistant that can adapt, learn, and integrate seamlessly into daily life — from managing schedules and studies to handling system-level tasks.
